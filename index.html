        <p class="p-4">
          Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian industrialist,
          philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Sons. He was a chairman of
          the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim chairman from October
          2016 through February 2017. He continues to head its charitable
          trusts.In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan, the second highest
          civilian honour in India, after receiving the Padma Bhushan, the third
          highest civilian honour in 2000.
        </p>

        <p class="p-4">
          He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of
          Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the
          Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree in
          architecture.He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop floor
          of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of Tata
          Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the Tata
          Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an attempt to
          turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a global business.
          Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in the world, having
          donated around 60â€“65% of his income to charity.

          investments in several startups. Tata has invested in over 30
          start-ups to date, most in a personal capacity and some via his
          investment company.
